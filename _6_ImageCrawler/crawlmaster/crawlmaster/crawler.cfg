flickr_message =  Hello, how's it going? I' have one favour to ask you. I'm a photographer and
                  I'm currently collecting photos of landscapes for research purposes.
                  I'm texting you because I really liked your photo library.   
                  Would you be okay with me using your photos for research/commercial
                  purposes?
